description: My first post on Medium as part of TWB

I authored my first post in the TWB Tech Blog on Medium: [**_Transfer Learning Approaches for Machine Translation_**](https://medium.com/twb-tech-blog/transfer-learning-approaches-for-machine-translation-5f4e71a33cd9). It's one of the main research focuses of the work I carry in _Translators without Borders_ as computational linguist.

A huge thanks to the Gamayun team, TWB communications channel and [Masakhane initiative](https://www.masakhane.io/).
