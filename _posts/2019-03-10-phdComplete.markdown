I am super content to have completed another chapter of my professional life as I have recently received my Phd degree after a 4 year-long journey. A journey that thought me many things that I wouldn't have even imagined to reach from the very beginning. 

I finalized my work supervised by Mireia Farrús and Antonio Bonafonte on the last quarter of 2018. On December 14th, I submitted my thesis to the board of doctoral studies of Universitat Pompeu Fabra. My thesis titled **_Incorporating Prosody into Neural Speech Processing Pipelines: Applications on automatic speech transcription and spoken language machine translation_** can be accessed through the following resources:

My thesis defense took place on 25th of February in UPF with the attendance of the tribunal consisting of David Escudero (Univ. de Valladolid), Francesc Alías (La Salle - URL) and Jordi Adell (Verbio Technologies). My whole defense presentation can be viewed through the following link:
