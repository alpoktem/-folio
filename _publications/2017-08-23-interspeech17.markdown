# Abstract

This paper presents an open-source tool that has been developed to visualize a speech corpus with its transcript and prosodic features aligned at word level. In particular, the tool is aimed at providing a simple and clear way to visualize prosodic patterns along large segments of speech corpora, and can be applied in any research that involves prosody analysis.
